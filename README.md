# Abstract: Ideal Customer Behavior Analysis for Digital Wallet Application

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis project focused on identifying the 'ideal customer' for a digital wallet application. The analysis aims to unravel the characteristics and behaviors of the most valuable customers, understanding their engagement patterns, acquisition channels, and demographic profiles.

## Objectives
- **Demographic and Transactional Profiling**: To understand who the ideal customers are and how they interact with the platform.
- **Engagement Pattern Analysis**: To discover when and how frequently these customers engage with the app.
- **Effective Marketing Channels**: To identify the most successful channels for customer acquisition and retention.

## Purpose and Strategy
The insights from this analysis are geared towards:
- Enhancing marketing strategies by aligning efforts with effective acquisition channels.
- Tailoring app features to cater to the needs of ideal customers.
- Optimizing the user experience to increase customer satisfaction and engagement.
- Applying characteristics of ideal customers to expand the user base.

## Analytical Approach
We dissect user data along multiple dimensions:
- Transaction frequency and volume.
- Acquisition channel efficacy.
- Seasonal trends in user acquisition.
- Geographical distribution of customer acquisition.

## Note on Geospatial Map Visualization
The geospatial map, an integral part of our analysis showcasing the geographical distribution of ideal customers, is not directly included in the Jupyter Notebook to maintain a manageable file size for GitHub. Instead, we provide the code for this visualization in a separate `.txt` file (`map_code.txt`). Users interested in this aspect can easily integrate this map into their analysis by copying the code from the `.txt` file into the Jupyter Notebook.

## Repository Structure
This repository is structured to provide a clear and detailed understanding of the ideal customer for our digital wallet application. It includes the Jupyter Notebook with the analysis and a `.txt` file for the map visualization code, ensuring a comprehensive yet accessible exploration of our data.
